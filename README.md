### Over Of The Analysis:
Our investors want us the create a analysis that would help them to demostrate the benefits of their bike sharing program. To do so we used a dataset from New York Citibike-Share program for the month of August. We used Python Pandas to make sure we got the proper date and time in the column to retreive our data. We also used Tableau Public to bring our visualization to live and to be able to give our investors a visual of our findings.
